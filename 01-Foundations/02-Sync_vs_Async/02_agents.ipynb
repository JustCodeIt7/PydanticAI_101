    "# Running Agents\n",
    "There are five ways to run an agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- agent.run() — an async function which returns a RunResult containing a completed response.\n",
    "- agent.run_sync() — a plain, synchronous function which returns a RunResult containing a completed response (internally, this just calls loop.run_until_complete(self.run())).\n",
    "- agent.run_stream() — an async context manager which returns a StreamedRunResult, which contains methods to stream text and structured output as an async iterable.\n",
    "- agent.run_stream_events() — a function which returns an async iterable of AgentStreamEvents and a AgentRunResultEvent containing the final run result.\n",
    "- agent.iter() — a context manager which returns an AgentRun, an async iterable over the nodes of the agent's underlying Graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## agent.run()\n",
    "The simplest way to run an agent is to call its `run()` method. This is an async function which takes the same arguments as the agent's `invoke()` method, and returns a `RunResult` containing the completed response.\n"
