## **Part 2: Core Agent Capabilities**

- **Video 6: Diving Deeper: Agent Lifecycle (run, run_sync, run_stream)**
  - Synchronous execution with run_sync.
  - Asynchronous execution with run (coroutines, await).
  - Streaming responses with run_stream (asynchronous iterator).
  - Return types (AgentRunResult, StreamedRunResult).
  - Choosing the appropriate run method based on context.
- **Video 7: Giving Your Agent Tools (@agent.tool)**
  - Concept of tools (Python functions the LLM can call).
  - Using the @agent.tool decorator to register functions.
  - Leveraging type hints and docstrings for tool information.
  - Tool parameters and input schema generation.
  - Tool execution flow and LLM interaction.
- **Video 8: Enhancing Tools with Dependency Injection**
  - Need for external resources and context in tools.
  - Dependency Injection (DI) system in PydanticAI.
  - Defining dependency containers using @dataclass.
  - Associating dependencies with the agent (deps_type).
  - Accessing dependencies via RunContext.
  - Providing dependencies at runtime (deps argument).
- **Video 9: Dynamic System Prompts & Context**
  - Benefits of dynamic system prompts.
  - Defining system prompts as functions decorated with @agent.system_prompt.
  - Accessing dependencies in dynamic system prompts via RunContext.
  - Returning a string as the dynamic system prompt.
  - Using dependencies to personalize and adapt prompts.
- **Video 10: Managing Conversation History**
  - Need for conversational memory.
  - Accessing messages from previous runs (AgentRunResult).
  - Passing message history to subsequent runs (message_history argument).
  - Message objects (UserMessage, AssistantMessage, ToolMessage).
  - Implementing basic turn-by-turn conversation history.

### Video 11: Handling Errors Gracefully

- Types of errors in LLM applications.
